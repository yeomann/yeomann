### Hi there, I'm Danish 👋

#### I'm a Software Engineer :computer: working remotely and living in Istanbul, Turkey at the moment :tr:

- :pakistan: I'm originally from Pakistan, went Cyprus for studying at age of 18, spent 8 years there and now recently moved to Turkey.
- :speaking_head: اردو میری مادری زبان ہے, speak quite good english, ve ayrıca İyi Türkçe (öğreniyorum :smile: ) 
- :scroll: I'm currently working at [**Makeen Technologies LLC**](https://www.makeen.io/)
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.ts`, `.js`, `scss/css`, `.php` these days
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within **Stackoverflow [stackoverflow.com/users/3405849/danish](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3405849/danish)** or **Twitter**
- 💬 Ping me about **development**, **architecture**, **NodeJS**, **Javascript**, **Typescript**
- :postbox: Reach me: [twitter.com/yo_daniish](https://twitter.com/yo_daniish) and [idanishraza@gmail.com](mailto:idanishraza@gmail.com)
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I love to play videogames (huge FPS gaming enthusiast e.g Valorant, CSGO, Call of Duty) as one of my hobbies, I had plenty of time back when I was a student, but almost no game to play, now I've got tons of games over time, and don't have time to play them :sweat_smile: Steam: [www.steamcommunity.com/id/Yeomannn/]
